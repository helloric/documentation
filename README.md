# HelloRIC Documentation
This is the HelloRIC documentation repository, where all documentation of all components are aggregated, built and deployed.

Currently, all documentation and components are hosted in the locally hosted GitLab from the DFKI, so it is currently not possible, to build the documentation locally.

To update the documentation, trigger the `ci' workflow.

**THE DOCUMENTATION IS CURRENTLY WIP AND NOT PRODUCTION READY!**
